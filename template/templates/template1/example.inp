When a case is created from a template, any file listed in "replace.txt"
will be scanned for replacement tokens. Replacement tokens are any valid 
python variable name enclosed in double angle brackets, e.g. 
    <<name>>
    <<template>>
    <<parameter1>>
    <<parameter2>> 
When found, the tokens will be replaced with the appropriate value from 
from the case matrix parameter file, "case_matrix.csv". Replacement is a
simple textual substitution with the text from the case matrix parameter
file (with leading/trailing whitespace removed).

Typically, token replacement will be performed on the inpute file for an
analysis tool (e.g. dplr.inp) and possibly the script used to run the case
(run.sh). However, you can do token replacement in anything that is a text
file.
